# lsp-task-01
Welcome to our GitHub repository! Here, we practice the essentials of Git and GitHub. From `git init` to `pull`, `push`, `PR`, `merge`, and `rebase`, we dive into hands-on learning. Join us in honing our version control skills through practical exercises. Let's code and collaborate together!  #LeapCoders #Task01 #LSPs2024
