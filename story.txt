"Is it real?" 
It's the unforeseen story of a boy who lives in London. He 
wakes up daily, goes to college, comes home, does assignments, and helps 
parents at work. He has very few friends, which obviously clarifies that he 
is an introvert. His parents used to work on a decent salary basis, and they 
provided him with a dreamful childhood. His parents have always granted him 
whatever he has asked for; he has never heard any no's or but's. One day in 
an airless summer, something happened that changed his life forever. He was walking on the streets of London and he met a beggar.
The beggar asked him to give a few bucks. Rightfully so, the boy gave him 50 bucks immediately. Then he walked away.
To his utter surprise, the beggar also followed him all along. BLA BLA BLA BLA
